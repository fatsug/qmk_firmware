# The colemak keymap for katana60

Customized for Josef Adamcik with some fancy stuff.

- Arrows at the bottom right have dual functionality: tap -> arrow, hold -> modifier.
- Supports 4 default layers: Colemak Mac, Qwerty mac, Colemak Win/Linux, Qwerty Win/Linux. Swiching between layers is persistent.

Mac versus Win/Linux layers:

- modifiers are ordered differently. Mac version has (from middle to outer) CMD, ALT, CTRL, win/linux version has CTRL, ALT, CMD. It's ment to make switching between platforms easier. I'll still require some keymap changes in various software, but it does help with the biggest problem where main modifier for shortcuts on linux is usually ctrl but on mac it's cmd.
- Extend layer is different, so keys for "previous/next word" and "copy",   "paste", "cut", and "undo" work properly.
